# A-robust-method-of-denoising-experimental-micrographs-using-deep-learning
A attention-based neural network for robust denoising of (materials science microstructure) images. Combines phase-field simulations with Fourier transform techniques to remove noise while preserving critical structural details like grain boundaries. Features synthetic training data generation and demonstrates exceptional performance across multiple magnifications on FeMnNi alloy systems.
